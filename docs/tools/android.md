## What is Android?

The AOSP (Android Open Source Project) also known as Android is an Open Source Kernel based on Linux primary used for mobile devices  devices like smartphones and tablets. 
While the code primary runs with propietary software based on Google's and Vendor's ecosystems, the quality of being an easily accesible to the public infrastructure has allow to the creation of a variety versions of the ecoystem, called primary as ROMS 

## General Advices

For anyone who doesn't want to get into the amount of detail this document convenes just now, here is some general advices for any Android user to make their device safer

 * Assign a safe password for your device lock. Remember to make it as unique as you can
 * Don't use default propietary apps. They are not only unfunctional most of the time, but are a privacy leak for you. That include things like default browsers, App store, etc
 * Don't download anything that seems strange
 * Privacy wise (with some excepctions) FOSS > Propietary Apps
 * Be careful with the apps you install, either from FOSS Markets or the Google Play Store one. Both can be prone to malicious software if not careful
 * Check your app usage permissions. Camera, GPS, Contact, Email, etc. Be careful what you let apps see
 * Don't give your number on sites or to people you don't trust. Some phones have two SIM chips, which can be useful if you want a disposable number
 * If you really don't need an app, just uninstall it 

## What are ROMS?

Have you ever noticed how your smartphone interface looks different from the one a family member of yours or a tablet your friend uses? This is because each seller that uses Android as their main OS modifies it to create their own ROM fitting for the need
of the company and their devices, with it's own special settings and apps. 

However, while their funcionality can varie, it's obvious that privacy wise their propietary software and OS can be in a really bad position for anyone that cares about keeping their data safe,
and are known for restricting the user in a variety of aspects of the control of their own systems. Because of this, users at large have been inventing a variety of solutions and custom ROMS and FOSS apps to facilitate moving towards certain goals 

Depending on your objectives and mobile device specifications, you may need to do your own research outside of the spectrum of this document. However, here is some standard information that you may want to get into it

## What are Custom ROMS? 
Because of the nature of the Project, a variety of user communities have made their general and privacy needs, which can go from the elimination of unwanted telemetry to the adding of features or even copying whole ecosystems to be used on devices that normally wouldn't allow them

## What Custom ROMS are out there?

While there is a big amount of them out there, here is a lit of the most supporte and used one on the current device ecosystems.

WARNING: Using a Custom ROM will void your guarranty. While the process of instalation can be simple based on the clear instructions (specially on Lineage OS), it can lead to issues and in the worst case scenario, bricking the device. Remember to be sure before trying anything at all

WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO, AND REMEMBER TO READ INSTRUCTIONS CORRECTLY 

  * LineageOS - As Vanilla Android gets
  * Pixel Experience - Simulating Google's Pixel OS features
  * Paranoid Android - Vanilla Android, but with an aesthetically pleasant UI twist 

Out of all of them, LineageOS tends to be the one to go for most people starting out, as it has compatibility with tons of devices, good stability and generally is supported for a long range of time and Android Versions.

## What is FOSS Apps?

In today's technological landscape, is easy to forget the beginning of home made apps (homebrew, as some people may put it) that used to be all around the start of personal computers. Now on days, apps tend to be standarized and created by big technological companies like Google, Microsoft, Samsumg, etc.

While this has given better accessibility to consumers in some regard, this also has made some apps not only abusing on pricing or unfunctional to a point, but sometimes straight up dangerous, security or privacy wise. 
Best on the effort of colaborators and users, FOSS Apps (as in Free Open Source Software) apps can become an tentative alternative to some of the big apps that are there on the market, or even allow the modification of certain apps to add better features to them 

Some examples of the most popular ones

  * F-Droid - The Biggest Repo market for FOSS Apps. Comes in a lot of custom flavors too
  * Aurora Store - An alternative for the Play Store for those who don't want to give Google Data
  * Micro G Project - A Open Source version that covers the need of the Play Services (Play Store, Youtube, etc)
  * ReVanced - A general modificaton project to patch propietary apps. Such modifications can range from custom themes to blocking ads
  * FairEmail - An alternative client for email services (Not to confuse with the Email service itself)
  * Aegis Authenticator - 2FA encrypted app blocked securly behind a password 
  * AdAway - General Android Adblocker (This can be less or more convenient depending on your phone use)

Social media has their own amount of custom clients created by the community 
 * Reddit - Infinity, Boost, Relay, or Stealth
 * Twitter - Nitter

Take in mind, some of this apps may require rooting for a better or more seemingless funcionaility 

## Ok, but what is ROOTING?

Rooting, as in getting to the "root" of the device, allows users to access and control the totallity of the advice without any interference from safety nets made for the common user, essencialy making users administrators of the device 
Being a common practice since the beginnings of the smartphone uprising, rooting it's a most go for a lot of more experienced users to give their own devices the patches and modifications that they seem fit, being by using apps or they modifing things manually,
debloating or forcing the installation of custom apps as systemwise ones

## Should I root my device?

That is a hard question. As companies stop putting let's walls for most common users needs, and start fighting more and more against rooting (looking at you, Google), the question of if Rooting is becoming a thing of the past plagues the scene constantly. 
While privacy wise, a rooted device allows those who care about their data and customizing thier devices better more freedom, efforts against this, being hardware wise or software wise are making more and more users go back on their rooting efforts

An example of this is Google's Play Integrity API, the evolution of their constant efforts against rooting, allowing app developers to block users from using apps if they detect any system modification as a "safety" measure. While the community is constantly
on the run of fighting against this, this companies are proving to give more and more stronger walls for the scene to go against, which could put rooting obsolete in a few decades or even years 

That being said, this is just speculation from our part, there is actually no way to know the true prevalance of rooting, but it is true that it's a decision the user has to do, and have enough preparation and understanding of the consequences and measures before 
entering on it

TL:DR: Investigate yourself, and decide if it's worth for you

WARNING: IT CAN BE A DANGEROUS PROCEDURE IF NOT DONE CORRECTLY AND MESS UP YOUR WHOLE OPERATING SYSTEM. I REPEAT, INVESTIGATE AND READ CAREFULLY BY YOURSELF
