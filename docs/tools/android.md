## What is Android?

The AOSP (Android Open-Source Project), also known as Android is an Open-Source Kernel based on Linux, primarily used for mobile devices such as the smartphones and tablets that we use on a daily basis. While a significant portion of the code involves proprietary software designed for closed ecosystems by Google and device manufacturers, the project's openness and accessibility to the public have given rise to a diverse array of custom ecosystem versions, commonly referred to as ROMs.

## General Advice

For the people that prefer a concise overview over delving into the detailed content of this article, here are some general tips to make your Android devices safer:

 * Use a safe password for your device lock. Remember to make it as unique as you can.
 * Avoid the default proprietary apps as much as you can. Not only do they often lack functionality, but are a serious hazard to your privacy. That includes default browsers and app stores.
 * Do not download strange files, nor install shady APKs from untrustworthy sources.
 * With some exceptions, a majority of the time Privacy-wise: FOSS > Proprietary Apps
 * Be cautious of the apps you install, may it come from the Google Play Store or from FOSS Repositories. Either can be prone to malicious software.
 * Make sure to check your apps' permissions. Camera, Location, SMS, Storage, Contacts, etc. Don't give apps permissions that they do not need to function.
 * Don't hand over your phone number on sites or people that you don't trust, your phone number is one of the least likely points of information to change about you. Some phones have Dual-SIM support, which can be useful if you have/plan to get a disposable prepaid number.
 * If you don't need or use an app anymore, just uninstall it.

## What are ROMS?

Have you ever noticed that your smartphone's interface looks different from a family member's? Despite them also having an android device? This is because each vendor that uses Android as their main OS modifies it to create their own ROM to fit their needs and promote their own ecosystem of apps.

While their functionality can vary, it's obvious that the proprietary nature of these custom vendor roms put anyone that actually cares about keeping their data secure in a bad position and are known to heavily restrict the freedom of the end user for the sake of control.

Because of this lack of freedom, many talented minds have taken a poke at the Open-Source nature of Android and have created their own set of custom ROMs and FOSS apps to strengthen the amount of control that the user has over their own devices.

Depending on your objectives and mobile device specifications, you may need to do your own research past what this article can tell you. However, there are some general pieces of information that you may want to know first.

## What are Custom ROMS? 
Because of the nature of these projects, a variety of communities have created new versions of the android operating system to fulfill their usage and privacy needs. This can range from the removal of all telemetry to the development of new features or even the expansion of ecosystems to be used on devices that normally would have no support whatsoever.

## What Custom ROMS are out there?

While there is a big amount of them out there, here is a lit of the most supporte and used one on the current device ecosystems.

WARNING: Using a Custom ROM will void your guarranty. While the process of instalation can be simple based on the clear instructions (specially on Lineage OS), it can lead to issues and in the worst case scenario, bricking the device. Remember to be sure before trying anything at all

WE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO, AND REMEMBER TO READ INSTRUCTIONS CORRECTLY 

  * LineageOS - As Vanilla as Android gets
  * Pixel Experience - Simulating Google's Pixel OS features
  * Paranoid Android - Vanilla Android, but with an aesthetically pleasant UI twist 

Out of all of them, LineageOS tends to be the one to go for most people starting out, as it has compatibility with tons of devices, good stability and generally is supported for a long range of time and Android Versions.

## What are FOSS Apps?

In today's technological landscape, is easy to forget the beginning of home made apps (homebrew, as some people may put it) that used to be all around the start of personal computers. Now on days, apps tend to be standarized and created by big technological companies like Google, Microsoft, Samsumg, etc.

While this has given better accessibility to consumers in some regard, this also has made some apps not only abusing on pricing or unfunctional to a point, but sometimes straight up dangerous, security or privacy wise. 
Best on the effort of colaborators and users, FOSS Apps (as in Free Open Source Software) apps can become an tentative alternative to some of the big apps that are there on the market, or even allow the modification of certain apps to add better features to them 

Some examples of the most popular ones

  * F-Droid - The Biggest Repo market for FOSS Apps. Comes in a lot of flavours too, my favorite is Droidify.
  * Aurora Store - An alternative for the Play Store for those who don't want to give Google Data
  * Micro G Project - A Open Source version that covers the need of the Play Services (Play Store, Youtube, etc)
  * ReVanced - A general modificaton project to patch propietary apps. Such modifications can range from custom themes to blocking ads
  * FairEmail - An alternative client for email services (Not to confuse with the Email service itself)
  * Aegis Authenticator - 2FA encrypted app blocked securly behind a password 
  * AdAway - General Android Adblocker (This can be less or more convenient depending on your phone use)

Social media has their own amount of custom clients created by the community 
 * Reddit - Infinity, Boost, Relay, or Stealth
 * Twitter - Nitter

Take in mind, some of this apps may require rooting for a better or more seemingless funcionaility 

## Ok, but what is ROOTING?

Rooting, as in getting to the "root" of the device, allows users to access and control the totallity of the advice without any interference from safety nets made for the common user, essencialy making users administrators of the device 
Being a common practice since the beginnings of the smartphone uprising, rooting it's a most go for a lot of more experienced users to give their own devices the patches and modifications that they seem fit, being by using apps or they modifing things manually,
debloating or forcing the installation of custom apps as systemwise ones

## Should I root my device?

That is a hard question. As companies stop putting let's walls for most common users needs, and start fighting more and more against rooting (looking at you, Google), the question of if Rooting is becoming a thing of the past plagues the scene constantly. 
While privacy wise, a rooted device allows those who care about their data and customizing thier devices better more freedom, efforts against this, being hardware wise or software wise are making more and more users go back on their rooting efforts

An example of this is Google's Play Integrity API, the evolution of their constant efforts against rooting, allowing app developers to block users from using apps if they detect any system modification as a "safety" measure. While the community is constantly
on the run of fighting against this, this companies are proving to give more and more stronger walls for the scene to go against, which could put rooting obsolete in a few decades or even years 

That being said, this is just speculation from our part, there is actually no way to know the true prevalance of rooting, but it is true that it's a decision the user has to do, and have enough preparation and understanding of the consequences and measures before 
entering on it

TL:DR: Investigate yourself, and decide if it's worth for you

WARNING: IT CAN BE A DANGEROUS PROCEDURE IF NOT DONE CORRECTLY AND MESS UP YOUR WHOLE OPERATING SYSTEM. I REPEAT, INVESTIGATE AND READ CAREFULLY BY YOURSELF
