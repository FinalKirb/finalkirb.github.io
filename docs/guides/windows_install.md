# Windows Install
This guide won't be an end-all solution to install windows as there may still be some telemetry left. If you're concerned about your privacy and are reluctant to use windows, then you should give Linux a try.

## Setup
Do not use Microsoft Account if you want to have at least some kind of privacy

Shift F10
OOBE\BYPASSNRO
restart computer

Let's connect to the internet! -> "I don't have internet"


Fail the microsoft account login by spamming invalid credentials multiple times
In the "Email, phone or Skype" section type in 'a' and then press next.
Every time you press 'Next', you add one more 'a' into the text field and continue until it changes to a password input.
Afterwards, you do the same thing until it says "Oops! Something went wrong".
Now you can finally create a local account that isn't tied to you, input the username you want to use and press Next to select a password for your local account.
Make sure the password to your account is secure, as anyone with this password can get access to your computer. It's recommended to use a password manager to create and store secure passwords, it's recommended to have at least 10 characters with at least one of each; uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters (?!_@#$).
Now you have to input security questions. If you're concerned about this information being traced back to you by microsoft, you can make up answers and note them down in a password manager for future use.
