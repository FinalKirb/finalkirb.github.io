# Privacy

## What is privacy?

Privacy is an essential aspect of our lives that allows us to keep certain things personal and control who has access to our information. It's about maintaining boundaries and protecting our individuality.

Think of privacy as a door that you can choose to open or keep closed. It gives you the freedom to decide what you share, when you share it, and with whom you share it. Just like you wouldn't want strangers snooping through your personal belongings, privacy ensures that your personal information remains private unless you choose otherwise.

In today's digital age, privacy extends beyond our physical lives. When we go online, we leave digital footprints everywhere. Whether we're posting on social media, shopping online, or using messaging apps, our personal data is being collected and stored over long periods of time, sometimes even indefinitely.

Your data holds great influence and power over the internet, and it is our responsibility to keep it from ending up in the wrong hands by protecting it.

## Why should you care about privacy?

Imagine a scenario where a random company you signed up for years ago, that has collected excessive amounts of personal information about you experiences a data breach. This breach exposes not only your name and contact details, but also sensitive details such as your financial information, medical history, and even intimate conversations. The consequences of such a breach go far beyond the surface-level "I have nothing to hide" argument.

First and foremost, privacy is a fundamental human right. In the same way that you close the door when changing clothes or draw the curtains for a private conversation, privacy in the digital world allows you to maintain personal boundaries and protect your identity.

When a company records excessive personal information, it creates a goldmine of data that, if compromised, can lead to severe consequences. In the event of a data breach, this information could end up in the hands of cybercriminals and malicious actors that use your collected data against you.

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you or someone you know started constantly receiving suspicious emails, mimicking legitimate services like Spotify or banking institutions? These emails may attempt to deceive you into giving out your login credentials, opening malicious attachments, or clicking on suspicious links. This could be as a result of a website you signed up for falling victim to a data breach, resulting in malicious actors using the email addresses and personal data obtained from that breach to target unsuspecting individuals like family and friends or are used in identity fraud.

Hence, you should be careful as you hand out your E-Mail address when signing up for online services. If you're signing up for something you'll only use once, use a second/burner E-Mail address you don't particularly care about and delete any accounts on websites you no longer need.

## What's the difference between Privacy, Security and Anonymity?

<blockquote>

Privacy

- Privacy is the assurance that your data is only seen by the parties you intend to view it. In the context of an instant messenger, for example, end-to-end encryption provides privacy by keeping your message visible only to yourself and the recipient.

Security

- Security is the ability to trust the applications you use—that the parties involved are who they say they are—and keep those applications safe. In the context of browsing the web, for example, security can be provided by HTTPS certificates.
- Certificates prove you are talking directly to the website you're visiting, and keep attackers on your network from reading or modifying the data sent to or from the website.

Anonymity

- Anonymity is the ability to act without a persistent identifier. You might achieve this online with Tor, which allows you to browse the internet with a random IP address and network connection instead of your own.
