## What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows you to securely connect to a different network over the internet. In the context of subscription services, this essentially lets you browse the web with the IP Address of your VPN provider. The provider in this case acts as a middleman; It redirects all of your internet traffic through the VPN Server and then the VPN Server talks directly to the website and vice versa.

This means, that the website you're visiting can only see the IP Address of the VPN Server, not your own.

## What can a VPN do?

- Mask your IP Address
- Spoof your Location
- Bypass Geoblocking - Depending on the VPN Server you're connected to, you can trick the website of choice into thinking you're in a different country than the one you're actually in to watch blocked content.
- Bypass Censorship

## What can a VPN NOT do?

- Anonymize you - When using a VPN, you're redirecting your trust from your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to the VPN provider. If the VPN provider is untrusted and logs your traffic/data, it would be the same as giving a stranger your car keys to go for a test ride.
- Speed up your internet - With the exception of very very specific niche cases, a VPN Server will always be at least a little bit slower than directly accessing a site, as you have an extra connection where the traffic needs to go.
